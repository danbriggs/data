# data

Use this to find out which counties had a significant change in the number of new cases per day per capita between two date ranges: one before, and the other after, a certain day.

If you have Python 3, click on the green "Code" button and then "Download ZIP." Once you have unzipped it, run cases_by_county.py.

The only packages it uses are numpy, pyplot, csv, collections, and os.path.

The input prompts make it clear what to type. You can get the names of counties in the top and bottom decile of change in number of new cases across that date that are in a given state; and for Texas, you can get their Public Health Region numbers as well.
